# **Deliverable 1: inception**

## **Intro by Shlok:**

We are introducing the “Gas Collector” website, which will help people browse   
gas stations around the area with their live prices. Considering a scenario, if   
a gas station which is 1 mile away from your usual space but with 35 cents   
cheaper, it can profit you in these times of inflation. The whole and sole   
purpose of this website is to save money for the user and make it a smooth   
experience for them. In these times of rising gas prices, even 10 cents cheaper   
gas can help local businesses build up their profit. The gas prices surging   
really high due to Russia being at war causing inflation around the country.   
This website will help its users know the real-time live prices of gas stations   
in their respective local areas. It consists of different features like filters   
based on prices, distance, and services available. The objective of this website  
is to offer a user-friendly experience to find a gas station around the area   
with the lowest gas prices. Gas Collector runs on the idea of an advertising   
revenue model.  

##  **Initial proposition value and consumer segment by Paul:**

initial value proposition:  
Since our app initially displays lower gas prices our initial   
proposition would be:  
**Gas Collector brings you the prices you want**

Initial consumer segments:  
Our consumer segment is kinda broad, encompassing people who drive their own cars  
and go out often. Not people who take the bus, or people whose fuel expenses are  
covered by their job (i.e., truck drivers).

#### 3.)  
Interviewee Name: Joseph “Joey” Mitchell  
1. How often do you drive?  
A: I work door dash so I drive often, I usually drive everyday but when I’m working it’s from Mondays-Wednesdays and Saturdays.


2. What type of vehicle do you drive?   
A: I drive a Subaru Outback.


3. How far would you say that you normally drive?  
A: I track my miles with Everlance for tax purposes, I usually drive 40-45 miles when working.


4. How would you describe the distance between work and your home compared to normal trips?  
A: It depends on the route I’m going so I can’t really say.



5. When do you refuel your vehicle and how often would you say you have to refuel?  
A: I usually refuel my vehicle when it’s about to hit empty. Usually once a week.


6. How do you feel about driving further to get better gas prices at the pump?  
A: I feel like it’s a necessary evil in today’s world. Especially since gas prices are getting higher and higher. When I'm in Flagstaff I usually go to Sam’s club which is about a 3 mile drive from my apartment. But when I'm in my hometown I go to Costco which is about a 10 mile drive from my house. The nearest gas station is about a 1 mile drive for both flagstaff and my hometown but I go to these pumps because they’re cheaper.

7. How does current gas prices affect your attitude towards filling up your gas when it's not necessary?  
A: It really affects my attitude when it's not necessary. I usually drive down to Sedona with my girlfriend to go on a hike on Sunday’s and it really hurts when I got to spend $25 to top up my tank.


8. Would you be willing to use an app that compares gas prices of various stations around your location?  
A: Of course I would, I've been looking for an app like that but usually they require subscription services and other stuff where It makes it harder to access.



9. Any questions you feel I should have asked or just anything you'd like to add?  
A: Nope.

### Paul
#### 1.)
Interview with my brother-in-law  
Q: How often do you go out?  
A: Almost every day.  
Q: What mode of transportation do you take usually?  
A: vehicle (he owns one)  
Q: How far would you say is your workplace from home?  
A: 50 miles both ways, 20 miles one way.  
Q: How often would you say you find your fuel gauge on low?  
A: 2 and 1/2 days.  
Q: Do you hesitate to fuel up given circumstances surrounding current gas prices?  
A: No, I fuel up more so based on convenience and location.  
Q: what else should do you think I have asked you?  
A: "Where would you fuel at and why would you fuel?"  There are different   
companies and gas stations to consider. For example circle k has the cheapest   
gas prices in Williams however I don't trust their gas. I trust Loves and 76.   
(I didn't press him on further since technically he already answered this, see   
"Do you hesitate to fuel up..." question).

#### 2.)
Interview with my Deacon  
Q: How often do you go out?  
A: Three times a day  
Q: What mode of transportation do you take usually?  
A: SUV ( he owns it)  
Q: How far would you say is your workplace from home?  
A: 50 miles from church, I also run other errands nearby.  
Q: (if they take their own vehicle) How often would you say you find your fuel  
gauge on low?
A: I start with a full tank and run it to low. I Usually fuel up one to two  
times a week.  
Q: Do you hesitate to fuel up given circumstances surrounding current gas  
prices? Or do you prefer to fuel up based on location/convenience?  
A: I prefer the lowest price. I Fuel up at Sam's Club because they are the lowest   
prices in Flagstaff.  
Q: what else should do you think I should have asked you?  
A: (He ponders this for a moment)"Do you see a lot or concern for gas prices   
within communities and extended communities?" The answer is yes. Gas is the   
number one driving force for inflation.

## **Final proposition value and consumer segment:**
Final proposition:  
Based on the interviews, and given how not everyone wants the lowest price, our   
revised proposition is now:   
**Gas Collector aggregates the best gas stations for you.**

Final consumer segment:  
We don't think our target market has changed much. There is a lot of people,  
especially those working in small business delivery whose fuel expenses aren't  
covered, that would benefit from this project the most. While initially we excluded  
truck drivers, they could still use this to plan out long trips by looking ahead  
and plotting the best case scenario for filling gas at different locations.

These customers/consumers are interested in an app that tracks gas prices and   
are willing to sacrifice their privacy to use it.  
The problem of location tracking seems to be minimal with most interviews   
showing a positive reception to the idea. One interview shows that there  
already is a market for the application and it seems to be filled with high cost  
subscriptions.
