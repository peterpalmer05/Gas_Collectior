# **Deliverable 1: inception**

## **Intro by Shlok:**

##  **Initial proposition Value and consumer segment by Paul:**

initial value proposition:  
Gas Collector brings you the prices you want

Initial consumer segments:  
kinda broad, people who drive their own cars and go  
out often. Not people who take the bus, or people whose fuel expenses are  
covered by their job (truck drivers I suppose).

Interview with my brother-in-law

Q: How often would you say you find your fuel gauge on low?  
A: 2 and 1/2 days.  
Q: Do you hesitate to fuel up given circumstances surrounding current gas prices?  
A: No, I fuel up more so based on convenience and location.  
Q: what else should do you think I have asked you?  
A: Where would you fuel at and why would you fuel?  There are different   
companies and gas stations to consider. For example circle k has the cheapest   
gas prices in Williams however I don't trust their gas. I trust Loves and 76.   
(I didn't press him on further since technically he already answered this, see   
"Do you hesitate to fuel up..." question).

times a week.  
Q: Do you hesitate to fuel up given circumstances surrounding current gas  
prices? Or do you prefer to fuel up based on location/convenience?  
A: I prefer the lowest price. I Fuel up at Sam's Club because they are the lowest   
prices in Flagstaff.  
Q: what else should do you think I should have asked you?  
A: (He ponders this for a moment)"Do you see a lot or concern for gas prices   
within communities and extended communities?" The answer is yes. Gas is the   
number one driving force for inflation.
