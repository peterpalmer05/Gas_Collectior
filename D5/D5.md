# 1. Description

Our system will display gas station locations based on proximity and/or price,
depending on user's preference. We will read from a txt file the user provides so that
our program can sort locations from this file. We may perhaps store these locations into a
linked list and perhaps arrange by bubbles sort. We have not settled on sorting
arrangements on this time.

to this location based on their sorting preference. Afterwards  they can save these
locations or arrange the list.
